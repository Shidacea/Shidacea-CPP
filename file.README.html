<p>What you see is the game engine Shidacea, decoupled from my game Inuhh
Shinvasion 2. It can be used for rapid development and full applications.</p>

<p>This repository is an engine, a template for game projects and also a
launcher for custom projects. Depending on your level of knowledge and
desire to mess around with my code, you can do several things:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Download projects from other people and launch them using an executable of
Shidacea</p>
</li><li>
<p>Write your own project using mruby scripts and test them directly</p>
</li><li>
<p>Compile your project into an executable using Shidacea</p>
</li><li>
<p>Change the core mruby scripts of Shidacea and add new ones</p>
</li><li>
<p>Wrap your own methods in C++ using the MrbWrap modules</p>
</li><li>
<p>Dive into mruby or one of the submodules and modify them</p>
</li><li>
<p>Disassemble the whole thing, write some assembly code and segfault yourself
into oblivion (not recommended)</p>
</li></ul>

<p>Overall, this engine was designed to appeal to many people instead of just
a single group. However, a certain degree of knowledge about Ruby is
needed.</p>

<h1 id="label-Idea+and+history">Idea and history</h1>

<p>This project was inspired by the RPG Maker series from Enterbrain and
complications with previous games written in Ruby. It aims to combine the
beauty of Ruby for scripting with the speed of C++ for critical procedures
while maintaining platform independency.</p>

<p>The original purpose of this engine was to serve as a backbone to Inuhh
Shinvasion 2, but it quickly became its own thing. Even if the original
idea was to create a Jump&#39;n&#39;run game, it can technically be used
for any 2D project.</p>

<p>The final version will include the following components:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Shidacea - The main engine</p>
</li><li>
<p>Launshi - A launcher for custom projects</p>
</li><li>
<p>Hyashi - A level editor</p>
</li></ul>

<h1 id="label-Requirements">Requirements</h1>

<p>The following programs need to be installed:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Compiler with C++17 support</p>
</li><li>
<p>CMake</p>
</li><li>
<p>Ruby</p>
</li><li>
<p>Bison</p>
</li></ul>

<p>For Windows you need to make sure that the paths leading to ruby.exe and
bison.exe are in the PATH variable. CMake can be obtained using Visual
Studio, which is the recommended option. Also make sure to avoid path names
with spaces in them, as mruby might fail to compile otherwise.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can use pre-compiled Windows binaries for each Shidacea
release version.</p>

<h1 id="label-Usage">Usage</h1>

<p>There are two main ways to use Shidacea.</p>

<p>First, you can compile Shidacea without any scripts to a launcher. If you
want to execute a project from someone else, just download its script files
and put them into the custom folder.</p>

<p>The second option is to compile your script files together with the
Shidacea engine. This allows for more optimized code at the expense of
portability. To use this, use <code>-DSHIDACEA_COMPILE_FRONTEND=ON</code>
as option for CMake, which will compile the frontend project as bytecode
directly into the executable.</p>

<p>It is also possible to use <code>-DSHIDACEA_COMPILE_SDCLIB=ON</code> to
compile the Shidacea library into the executable. This is done by default
in the release versions and recommended unless you want to change the
library functions.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the engine core with the SFML bindings can be disabled with
<code>-DSHIDACEA_EXCLUDE_SFML=OFF</code>. This is only necessary if you
want to use your own framework for Shidacea.</p>

<h2 id="label-Load+scripts+at+runtime">Load scripts at runtime</h2>

<p>Advantages: * Platform independent projects * Precompiled executables can
be used for common platforms * After installing Shidacea, you don&#39;t
need to touch it anymore</p>

<p>Disadvantages: * Everyone can see and modify your code without effort *
Evaluating the script files takes longer than using bytecode * You cannot
change the Shidacea core engine directly</p>

<h2 id="label-Precompiled+scripts">Precompiled scripts</h2>

<p>Advantages: * Faster evaluation of script files * Obfuscated scripts * You
have full control over the engine and can change core aspects</p>

<p>Disadvantages: * Your projects need to be recompiled every time you change
a script * You need to have at least basic knowledge about C++ compiling
and CMake * Your project needs to be recompiled for each platform</p>

<h1 id="label-Caveats">Caveats</h1>

<h2 id="label-Submodules">Submodules</h2>

<p>If you download this repository, make sure to download the submodules as
well, since a simple download won&#39;t include them. The best way to use
Shidacea is to fork it and use Git for maintaining it and updating the
submodules (e.g. using <code>git clone --recursive</code>).</p>

<p>List of current submodules: * mruby * SFML * ImGui * ImGui-SFML * MrbWrap *
Launshi * Collishi</p>

<h2 id="label-Loading+other+mruby+script+files">Loading other mruby script files</h2>

<p>The ruby instruction <code>require</code> is currently NOT available
(adding it as a gem would be possible, but not trivially applicable to the
concept of pre-compiled bytecode). This problem is circumvented by
specification of a JSON file in which the scripts are listed in execution
order. For example, the SDCLib and the frontend (e.g. Launshi) require the
use of a script order, as well as Launshi projects. It is possible to name
single files and complete directories (ending with a &#39;/&#39;). Note
that the order of scripts loaded in a directory needs to be regarded as
random, so avoid dependencies between files in a directory if loaded in a
batch.</p>

<h2 id="label-Linux+troubleshooting">Linux troubleshooting</h2>

<p>This project should (read: SHOULD) run on Linux systems. However, several
libraries are required to do so (see documentation for SFML). Some problems
are discussed below.</p>

<h3 id="label-Dependencies+are+missing+when+generating+or+compiling">Dependencies are missing when generating or compiling</h3>

<p>Make sure that g++, Ruby, Bison and CMake are installed properly. Also
visit the SFML documentation to check for requirements.</p>

<p>If the filesystem library is missing, g++ needs to be updated to version 8
or higher. If the problem persists after installing the missing libraries
and programs, you may want to reboot and try again.</p>

<h3 id="label-Executables+trigger+a+segmentation+fault+on+WSL">Executables trigger a segmentation fault on WSL</h3>

<p>Shidacea may not work correctly on WSL despite a successful compilation. If
a segmentation fault occurs on WSL, change the XServer application to
another one. The segmentation fault issue is known to occur on XMing, for
example. The Windows store application X410 works fine, but is not free.
Reverting SFML to an earlier version can also work.</p>

<h3 id="label-Shidacea+yields+other+error+messages+on+WSL">Shidacea yields other error messages on WSL</h3>

<p>Try the solution above first. If that does not help, the command
<code>export LIBGL_ALWAYS_INDIRECT=</code> might help, too. Also make sure
to properly connect your WSL with the correct XServer and a PulseAudio
server. If Shidacea runs otherwise flawlessly, some errors are completely
normal.</p>

<h3 id="label-Other+problems">Other problems</h3>

<p>Please report your problem as an issue if your problem is none of the above
or none of the solutions worked. Shidacea aims to be compatible to as many
platforms as possible, so please help reaching this goal.</p>
